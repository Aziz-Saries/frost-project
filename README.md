❄️ F3 Innovate Frost Risk Forecasting Challenge
Team TODO: Your Team Name

This repository contains our submission for the F3 Innovate Frost Risk Forecasting Challenge, where we forecast probabilistic frost risk for California specialty crop regions using CIMIS hourly meteorological data.

Our modeling pipeline focuses on:

Clean feature engineering from CIMIS stations

Interpretable ML for frost classification

Probabilistic outputs suitable for grower decision-making

Seasonal analysis and exploratory frost climatology

Gradient-boosted models (XGBoost) and Random Forests

Calibration & reliability evaluation where applicable
